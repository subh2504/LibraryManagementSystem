# LibraryManagementSystem

Implement a Library Management System (in the programming language of your choice) that provides the (tasks)
 1. Ability to add books to the system.
 2. Ability to add users to the system.
 3. Ability to lend books to users.
 4. Ability to return books to the library.
 5. Ability to limit the number of books borrowed by user.
 6. Ability to search a book by title, author.
 7. Ability to search a user by name
Guidelines
 1. Please implement the functionalities in the order as mentioned above.
 2. You do not need to implement any persistence mechanism - a database or files or in-memory database. Please use the Java’s basic data
    structures like List, Map etc.
 3. Please write a production quality code. Ex: Even though the current requirement is to store everything in-memory, we should have the
    ability to replace it with a persistence layer, say, MySQL.
 4. It is sufficient to have the ability to interact with your program using main() method. It is optional to build a user interface or
    command line app.
Evaluation Criteria (In the order of priority)
1. Correctness - The code should compile and execute correctly. It should not break, say, for invalid inputs. If you have shortage of
    time, focus on implementing, say, first 4 tasks correctly rather than implementing all the 7 tasks incorrectly.

 2. DRY - Wherever applicable follow DRY - Don’t Repeat Yourself.

 3. Completeness - Implementing all the 7 tasks, of course correctly, is the third priority.

 4. Code quality - All the aspects of code quality. Ex: OOPS, Naming Conventions etc.
